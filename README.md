# 😁 Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub, I’m Arief from Indonesia.

I enjoy building systematic strategies, making data driven decisions, and spotting patterns in market behavior.

On a daily basis it’s learning, backtesting, learning, backtesting — rinse and repeat. I really believe that past performance can indicate future results (psst... NVDA’s move wasn’t a total surprise, sometimes the past leaves clues ^_^).

This space is where I share some of the things I'm building, testing, and exploring.
