# 😁 Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub, I’m Arief from Indonesia.

I turn math into quant systems to decode market behavior. If it mixes math and markets, I’m in.

On a daily basis it’s learning, backtesting, learning, backtesting, rinse & repeat. I really believe that past performance can indicate future results (NVDA’s move wasn’t a total surprise, sometimes the past leaves clues ^_^).

Once I find a strategy, I break it, patch it, and run it back. Somewhere along the way, it stopped about money. I just love the challenge. Cracking the market is the real reward.

Here’s where I share what I’m building, testing, and tearing apart.
