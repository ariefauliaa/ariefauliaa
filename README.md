# 📊 Quantitative Investing Projects

Welcome to my GitHub, I’m Arief from Indonesia.

I focus on quantitative analysis, especially in the financial markets. I'm into building systematic investing strategies and frameworks, making data driven decisions, and constantly searching for patterns in market behavior.

On a daily basis? It’s learning, backtesting, learning, backtesting — rinse and repeat. I really believe that past performance can indicate future results (psst... NVDA’s move wasn’t a total surprise — sometimes the past leaves clues ^_^).

This space is where I share some of the things I'm building, testing, and exploring.
