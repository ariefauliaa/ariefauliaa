# 😁 Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub, I’m Arief from Indonesia.

I’m all about turning math into quant systems that help decode market behavior. Anything that blends math and the markets instantly gets my attention.

On a daily basis it’s learning, backtesting, learning, backtesting, learning, backtesting, rinse & repeat. I really believe that past performance can indicate future results (NVDA’s move wasn’t a total surprise, sometimes the past leaves clues ^_^).

Once I find a solid strategy, I try to break it, find the weak spots, fix them, and then run it all back again. Somewhere along the way, it stopped about money. I just love the challenge. Cracking the market is the reward.

This space is where I share some of the things I'm building, testing, and exploring.
