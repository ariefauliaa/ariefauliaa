# 😁 Introduction

Welcome to my GitHub, I’m Arief from Indonesia.

My focus is on turning mathematical ideas into quantitative investing systems that decode market behavior. Anything that blends math and the markets instantly gets my attention.

On a daily basis it’s learning, backtesting, learning, backtesting, learning, backtesting, rinse and repeat. I really believe that past performance can indicate future results (NVDA’s move wasn’t a total surprise, sometimes the past leaves clues ^_^).

This space is where I share some of the things I'm building, testing, and exploring.
